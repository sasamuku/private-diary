# Product Context: Private Diary

## Why This Project Exists
Private Diary was developed to address the need for recording personal thoughts and experiences while maintaining privacy in the digital age. Many existing diary apps and services do not guarantee true privacy as user data can potentially be accessed by third parties. Private Diary solves this problem by providing a completely secure diary platform that only the user themselves can access.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Lack of Privacy**: Many diary apps store user data on central servers, potentially accessible by service providers or third parties.
2. **Technical Barriers**: Building your own secure diary site typically requires advanced technical knowledge.
3. **Customization Limitations**: Existing solutions restrict users' freedom to customize according to their needs.
4. **Long-term Sustainability**: Commercial services may be discontinued due to company policy changes or acquisitions.

## How It Works
Private Diary functions as follows:

1. **User Authentication**: Only authenticated users can access through a secure login system.
2. **Diary Entry Creation**: Users can create diary entries for each date.
3. **End-to-End Encryption**: All diary content is encrypted client-side and stored only in encrypted form.
4. **Monthly View**: Users can browse diary entries by month.
5. **Favorites Feature**: Specific entries can be marked as favorites.
6. **Personal Deployment**: Users deploy completely independent diary sites using their own Supabase and Vercel accounts.

## User Experience Goals
Private Diary aims to provide the following user experience:

1. **Simplicity**: An intuitive interface that allows users to start writing immediately without complex setup or operations.
2. **Peace of Mind**: A completely private space where users can freely express their thoughts and feelings.
3. **Accessibility**: Easy to set up and use regardless of technical knowledge level.
4. **Sustainability**: A long-term solution controlled by the users themselves.
5. **Adaptability**: Customizable to individual preferences and needs.
