# Active Context: Private Diary

## Current Work Focus
The Private Diary project currently has basic functionality implemented. The main focus areas are:

1. **Core Feature Stabilization**: Improving the stability of basic features such as diary entry creation, display, and favorites functionality
2. **User Authentication Enhancement**: Currently only GitHub authentication is supported, but additional authentication methods are being considered
3. **UI Improvements**: Enhancing user experience and optimizing responsive design
4. **Security Strengthening**: Implementing and validating client-side encryption

## Recent Changes
The project has the following components and features implemented:

1. **Authentication System**:
   - Login functionality using GitHub OAuth
   - Authentication state management and session persistence

2. **Main View**:
   - Month selector (MonthSelector) to display diary entries for specific months
   - Diary post list (PostList) to display diary entries
   - New post form (NewPost) to create diary entries

3. **Diary Entry Features**:
   - Text input and saving
   - Favorite marking functionality (StarButton)

4. **Database Structure**:
   - Schema definition through Supabase migrations
   - Data access control through RLS policies

## Next Steps
The following are planned as next steps for the project:

1. **Additional Authentication Methods**:
   - Adding email/password authentication
   - Adding social logins (Google, Twitter, etc.)

2. **Feature Extensions**:
   - Image upload functionality
   - Rich text editor integration
   - Tagging functionality
   - Search functionality implementation

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Complete implementation of end-to-end encryption
   - Security audit and vulnerability testing

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Improving load times for cases with many entries
   - Implementing caching strategies

5. **Mobile Support**:
   - Optimizing responsive design
   - Adding PWA (Progressive Web App) functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
1. **Encryption Strategy**:
   - Implementation method for client-side encryption (Web Crypto API vs. third-party libraries)
   - Key management and recovery mechanisms

2. **State Management**:
   - Currently using React's basic state management
   - Considering Zustand, Jotai, Redux, etc. if complexity increases

3. **Data Fetching**:
   - Appropriate separation of server components and client components
   - Utilizing SWR, React Query, or Next.js data fetching capabilities

### UX/UI Considerations
1. **Mobile First**:
   - Prioritizing usability on mobile devices
   - Optimizing touch interfaces

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Screen reader support
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Contrast and readability

3. **Offline Support**:
   - Diary creation and synchronization functionality when offline

### Business/Product Decisions
1. **Open Source Community**:
   - Creating contribution guidelines
   - Setting up issue templates and pull request templates

2. **Documentation**:
   - Creating user guides
   - Expanding developer documentation

3. **Feature Prioritization**:
   - Core privacy features vs. additional features
   - Adjusting priorities based on user feedback

## Current Challenges
1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Seamless integration between multiple authentication methods
   - Optimizing session management

2. **Data Structure**:
   - Schema design that can accommodate future feature extensions
   - Efficient query performance

3. **Security**:
   - Complexity of implementing end-to-end encryption
   - User-friendly methods for key management and recovery

4. **Scalability**:
   - Performance with large numbers of entries
   - Optimal usage within Supabase limitations
